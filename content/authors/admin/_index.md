Hi! I am Aniruddha Pathak. I am a doctoral student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State Univerisity](https://www.iastate.edu/). Currently I am working with [Prof. Somak Dutta](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/somakd/).

Before joining ISU, I received my M.Sc. in Statistics from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) in 2020 and my B.Sc.(Hons) in Statistics from [Ramakrishna Mission Residential College (Autonomous), Narendrapur](https://rkmrc.in/), [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/) in 2018.

During Summer 2019, I worked with [Prof. Saurabh Ghosh](https://www.isical.ac.in/~saurabh/), [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/) as part of the IASc-INSA-NASI Summer Research Fellowship Program 2019.

My research interests include Statistical Classification, Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Kernel Density Estimation.

Outside of research, I have a keen interest in trivia quizzes, History and Geopolitics.

This is my [CV](https://anipath.github.io/media/APathak_CV.pdf) (Last updated in August 2022).
